```
"react-native": "npm:react-native-tvos@<version>"
```

   yarn start
   ```
2. For web,
   ```
   yarn web
   ```
   Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:19006 to access the application.

### Add your video sources

- Sample source can be found at [/src/services/tv/sample.ts](/src/services/tv/sample.ts)

1. Add your source satisfy the following [types](/src/services/tv/types.ts).

   ```typescript
   export type TVideoProvider = {
     /**
      * Called when application first boot up, showing videos in home screen
      */
     getHomeVideoList(): Promise<TVideosRec[]>;

     /**
      * Called when `more` button is clicked on home screen
      * @param path url to the video category
      */
     getVideoCategory(path: string): Promise<TVideosRec[]>;

      /**
      * Called when reached the end of category screen
      * @param path url to the video category list
      * @param page next page to load
      */
      getVideoCategoryMore(path: string, page: number): Promise<TVideosRec>

     /**
      * Called when video card is clicked
      * @param path url to the video
      */
     getVideoSources(path: string): Promise<TVideoSources>;

     /**
      * Called when video episode is clicked
      * @param path url to find the playable video url (e.g. mp4, m3u8...)
      */
     getVideoUrl(path: string): Promise<string>;

     /**
      * Called when video search is performed
      * @param keyword video search keyword
      */
     getVideoSearchResult(keyword: string): Promise<TVideo[]>;

     /**
      * Called when favourite videos are loaded from local storage
      * to ensure videos status are up to date
      * @param video favourite video stored in local
      */
     updateVideoStatus(video: TVideo): Promise<TVideo>;
   };
   ```
